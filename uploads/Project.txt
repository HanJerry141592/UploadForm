Needs to look good
 - For all emails please use a good looking and responsive free template

.htaccess
 - Make it so that domain.com/some-company-name goes to Main.php?redirect=some-company-name

Main.php (assuming we're at "some-company-name")
 - A "Download All" button that opens a Sweet Alert 2.0 (see below) where the file is a .zip of all the documents at this location
 - Swipable carousel of documents (with left and right navigation arrows)
   - Is this okay to use? http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick
   - Each carousel item should have:
     - The name of the document
     - The brief description of the document (if available)
     - The thumbnail of the document
     - A "Get" button with a Font Awesome "file-download" icon to the left of the text
       - Tapping this button should open a Sweet Alert 2.0
         - The HTML inside the Sweet Alert 2.0:
           - Email (the document to themselves)
           - Text (the document to themselves)
           - Download (the document)
             - Attempt to use the Web Share API (better) and if it's not compatible then do something like what's in Download.php (attached, worse)
           - Dropbox (upload document)
           - Box (upload document)
           - Google Drive (upload document)
           - OneDrive (upload document)
